# Two-Nested-Spirals
This project is a homework of Neural Network.

The basic knowledge is from Andrews' `deeplearning.ai` course from `Coursera`.

Some codes or ideas are from https://github.com/JudasDie/deeplearning.ai

I am very grateful to JudasDie for his records of deepleraning.ai-course.

the algorithm to generate Two-Nested-Spirals data is from W Zhao, DS Huangï¼Œ`The structure optimization of radial basis probabilistic neural networks based on genetic algorithms` Published in: Proceedings of the 2002 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks. IJCNN'02 (Cat. No.02CH37290)

Thanks for Andrew Ng!

Thanks for JudasDie!
